<p>
I'm an Electronics-n-Communication Engineering student with a deep interest in how things work under the hood, whether its a processor
pipeline, Computer Architecture(x86, ARM, RISC-V), an FPGA, or CUDA kernels. I love building stuff from scratch, breaking down and
understanding each and every layer of it hardware/software and from high to low level programming.

<p>
My work often revolves around low-level programming, digital design, and making things faster, smoother and effieciently. Whether I'm writing
Python for a compute library or touching low level programming (ARM assembly) on the surface level. I enjoy exploring systems that sit at the
edge of hardware and software.

<strong>
I'm looking for opportunities that let me get my hands dirty on real world problems, and contribute something meaningful while learning from
the best minds, engineers and humans in the industry.
